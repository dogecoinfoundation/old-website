			<h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
			<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is a venture designed to help empower community spirit and improve the user experience. We are <u>not</u> a steering committee that decides and guides the fate of dogecoin, we are simply a conduit and escrow service for projects that help the community and which would not otherwise generate a financial reward for the creator.</p>
			<h4 style="padding-top:20px"><u>We pledge to:</u></h4>
			<p><b>Provide a reliable and trustworthy medium</b><br/>Users can donate to various causes and development projects and be sure that their coins are going to a legitimate fund.</p>
			<p><b>Provide unbiased listings</b><br/>If a cause or project meets our criteria, then we will list it. We will make no attempt to influence what the community should and should not support; the amount of doge donated is the true measure of the popularity or support an initiative has.</p>
			<p><b>Take no fee or commission from donations</b><br/>All donations sent to the foundation will stay in their respective wallet addresses and will not be touched until that fund is paid out in full to the person or persons with the rightful claim to it.</p>
			<p><b>Provide a transparent service</b><br/>The good thing about dogecoin is that this is inherent in the currency to begin with! Anyone can check the transaction history of all the wallet addresses we list at <a href="http://dogechain.info/chain/Dogecoin">dogechain.info</a>.</p>
			<p><b>Respect the wishes of the community</b><br/>With so many shibes it's inevitable that not everyone is going to have the same opinion on everything. We will however do our best to respect and respond to the general wishes and concerns of the community at large on any issue.</p>

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<h4>What is dogecoin?</h4>
				<p>Dogecoin is a new form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> similar to bitcoin that was created in late 2013.</p>
				<h4>How do I get started using dogecoin?</h4>
				<p>Simply head over to <a href="http://www.dogecoin.com">dogecoin.com</a> and download the free wallet app to start being able to send and receive dogecoin. There you will also find many links containing information about the coin and community.</p>
				<h4>Will dogecoin make me rich?</h4>
				<p>While this is not a question anyone can truthfully answer, we hope that most people who use Dogecoin do not do so primarily in expectation of this. There are countless other coins on the market that exist as "pump and dump" mechanisms and we wish to differentiate ourselves from this practice.</p>
				<p>The point of any currency is to exchange it for goods and services so making a pile and hiding it in a secret lair is no good to anyone. We hope that through this foundation we can encourage the growth and use of dogecoin as the premier currency of the internet, rather than it existing as a fiat equivalent commodity.</p>
				<h4>So what's the deal with this foundation then?</h4>
				<p>The Dogecoin Foundation was created to promote use of the currency through a combination of goodwill, charitable, and promotional endeavors, and providing incentives to those with the skills to improve the experience of using the coin.</p>
				<p>The members of the dogecoin community have proven themselves time and time again to be a wonderful and generous bunch of people. From assisting new shibes getting set up to banding together to help victims of dishonest opportunists, they have always been forthcoming with aid. We aim to foster that environment by providing a trustworthy and transparent service in order to serve the dogecoin community to the best of our ability.</p>
				<h4>Who made the Dogecoin Foundation? Who runs it?</h4>
				<p>The Dogecoin Foundation was conceived by the original creators of dogecoin, BillyM2K (Billy Markus) and ummjackson (Jackson Palmer). The running of the foundation is open to input and management from all members of the core dogecoin team, co-ordinated by the foundation team leader.</p>
