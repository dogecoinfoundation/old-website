In order to make a distinction between the kinds of initiatives that we support within the Dogecoin community, and those designed to promote our brand and help the world at large, we have created a system of classification for the different types of things we do.

Anything that involves payments with Dogecoin is simple to list but since the success of our first promotion for the Jamaican bobsled team, we have been inundated with suggestions for various projects and although they are all worthwhile, it would be impractical for us to run them all.

####Ongoing Initiatives

These are the regular initiatives that already exist. Development bounties, listings for charities that directly accept Dogecoin donations, and anything else where the payment of a fund is a simple transfer of Dogecoins without converting them to another currency. These are the types of initiatives that anyone can suggest and have listed provided they meet the criteria laid out on our "About Us" page.

####Sponsored Initiatives

These are the kinds of initiatives that promote the Dogecoin brand and community to the wider world and by necessity involve a conversion of the fund into another currency at the end of the fundraiser. The Jamaican bobsled drive is a good example of this, as is our new doge4kids project.

The point of sponsored initiatives is to be a focused effort with a specific fundraising goal and end date, with a pre-defined outcome to be achieved at the end. Because of the nature of this as well as the effort involved, only one sponsored initiative will be run at a time.
