Greetings fellow shibes!  
  
Welcome to our new Foundation blog. Here you can keep up to date with all the latest Foundation news. This page is a little bare at the moment but I'd like to start maintaining weekly entries about the specifics of what we've been doing and announcing our future plans.  
  
Some of you may have noticed that there are always many plans in the works that are very slow to actually materialize. Our inbox is overflowing with unanswered emails and approved listings that still need to be set up and added to the site. The simple fact is that this has become far too big to be managed by the small team we have now, and we are looking for people to help out. If this is something you might consider doing please send your application to info@dogecoin.com. We are looking for people with some of the following skills:  
* Good written communication skills
* Basic knowledge of web development
* A high level of initiative and the ability to self-manage
* Enthusiasm for promoting Dogecoin
* Any additional skills you have that you think would benefit the Foundation

If any of this sounds like you then we look forward to hearing from you.
